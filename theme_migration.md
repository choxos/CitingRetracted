This is not a standalone project. It is a part of the XeraDB project. We have different themes for different projects. But all of them are based on the same core. You can find the core in ~/Documents/GitHub/xeradb/shared_theme folder. Previously, I applied the theme to another project (OST) and it worked well. You can find the OST project in ~/Documents/GitHub/OpenScienceTracker folder.

In the shared_theme folder, you can find the specifics for the PRCT project in css/themes/prct-theme.css. Now, I want to migrate PRCT to the new theme:

1. First, create a backup of the current PRCT project in a subfolder of the PRCT folder.

2. Then, assess all the files in the xeradb/shared_theme and OpenScienceTracker folders to understand the structure and the logic.

3. After that, apply the theme to the PRCT project. Please note that I want the PRCT project to be as colorful as the current one. But remain professional and minimalistic.

4. Commit
